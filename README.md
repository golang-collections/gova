Collections framework for Golang [beyond basic List, Set, Map]

I loved Java. Java Collections Framework (JCF) is something I love a lot.

Go is an awesome programming language. I would love to have JCF && Google Guava Collections (GGC) like collections in golang.

This repository is a set towards that goal.
